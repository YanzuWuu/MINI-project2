The trained model's files is here, however, github can only submit files smaller than 25Mb, so some data files cannot be submitted. If the trained model doesn't work without those file, don'e hesitate to connect me by email, I'll send u them.

My eamil address is yczhu1@bu.edu.

Or u can also train the model on ur computer, the process is not too long to endureï¼Œ about 7 minutes on my computer. But u have to download the training and test files by yourself, and don't forget to create a file to store the logs files.
